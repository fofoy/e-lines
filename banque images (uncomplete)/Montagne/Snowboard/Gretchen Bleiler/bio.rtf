\cf0 Bleiler aspired to compete in the Winter X Games from a very young age, and found her passion in snowboarding at age 11 (1992). She has been riding ever since and became professional in 1996. Among her accomplishments, she jump-started the invert revolution for female riders as the first to land a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Crippler_540&action=edit&redlink=1"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Crippler 540}} in competition, and won more halfpipe competitions in 2003, 2005 and 2006 than any other female snowboarder.In the pre-Olympic season she won four of the five US Olympic halfpipe qualifiers and is also a four-time {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Games"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 X Games}} gold medalist, most recently winning the superpipe at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_X_Games_XIV"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Winter X Games XIV}}.\
In 2003, she was a U.S. snowboard Grand Prix champion, a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=U.S._Open_(snow)&action=edit&redlink=1"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 U.S. Open}} of snowboarding champion, and a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Triple_Crown_of_Snowboarding&action=edit&redlink=1"}}{\fldrslt \cf4 Triple Crown of Snowboarding}} champion.\

Bleiler, who missed qualifying for the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 2002 Winter Olympics}} due to a tiebreaker, won a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_medal"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 silver medal}} in the women's {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-pipe"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 halfpipe}} at the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_Winter_Olympics"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 2006 Winter Olympics}} in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Turin}}, Italy\
Starting in 2007, Bleiler expanded her career into snowboard and outerwear design, through {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oakley,_Inc."}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Oakley}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K2_Snowboards"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 K2 Snowboarding}}, designing her own signature outerwear line for Oakley, and participating in the K2 Alliance, which develops and tests women's products, as well as working on the graphics for several K2 Boards. In 2008, she helped to create a new all-female invitational superpipe competition at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowmass_(ski_area)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Snowmass}} called the Snow Angels Invitational.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gretchen_Bleiler#cite_note-Gretchen_Bleiler_Interview-8"}}{\fldrslt

While competing in the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver_2010_Winter_Olympics"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics}}, many considered Bleiler a gold medal favorite. However, she fell on both of her final runs, and took 11th place.\
