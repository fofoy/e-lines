\f0\fs24 \cf2 \cb3 The only international rider to win XG Freestyle gold (2009), this Aussie innovator also scored Best Trick silver in '09 and bronze in '06. Unfortunately, Williams has had 8 separate surgeries since XG '09 and missed XG 2010 and XG 2011 with injuries. One of the most talented, respected and creative riders in freestyle, Bilko was the first to land a Cliff-flip and Ruler flip to dirt (Feb. '06 and early '07, respectively) as well as 360 variations like the Flying Dutchman. Look for the hard-charging Bilko to make an exciting return to XG.}
