\fs26 \cf0 \cb2 By the age of 17, Hamilton had become an accomplished surfer and could have left modeling to pursue a career on surfing's World Championship Tour. However, competitive surfing and contests never appealed to Hamilton, who had watched his father Bill endure the competitive surfing contest politics and the random luck of the waves in organized championship surfing events. Bill Hamilton regarded surfing more as a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul_Surfer"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 work of art}}, rather than based chiefly on wave-by-wave ride performance scored by judges.\
In the 1987 movie {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore_(film)"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf3 North Shore}}, Hamilton played the violent, antagonistic role of "Lance Burkhart". Despite further success in modeling during the 1980s, Hamilton, with his professional surfing upbringing, always intended a life of surfing, but continued to reject the professional contest circuit.\
In 1989 Laird featured in windsurfing movie "Moving Target" alongside Fred Haywood.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.stableroad.com/videos/movingtargetspeed.htm"}}{\fldrslt \cf5 Moving Target clip on stableroad}}\

\pard\pardeftab720\sl380\sa120

\b0\fs26 \cf0 An early attempt at media recognition was his quest to be the first surfer to complete a 360 degree loop while strapped to his board. The attempt was chronicled in Greg Stump's 1990 ski film, 
\i Groove - Requiem in the key of Ski
\i0 . In the early 1990s, Hamilton, along with a small group of friends collectively dubbed the "Strapped Crew" because their feet were strapped to their boards, pushed the boundaries of surfing at {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaws_surf_break"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Jaws surf break}} off the north central coast of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maui"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Maui}}. The Strapped Crew tackled bigger waves featuring stunts. Stunts included: launching 30-foot (9.1\'a0m) jumps on sailboards, then mating the boards to paragliders to experiment with some of the earliest kiteboards.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton#cite_note-8"}}{\fldrslt

In late 1992, Hamilton with two of his close friends, big wave riders {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrick_Doerner"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Darrick Doerner}} and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Buzzy_Kerbox&action=edit&redlink=1"}}{\fldrslt \cf6 Buzzy Kerbox}} (also an occasional men's fashion model; Hamilton and Kerbox later lost their friendship over a property disagreement),{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton#cite_note-deadmens-3"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 [3]}} started using inflatable boats to tow one another into waves which were too big to catch under paddle power alone. This innovation is chronicled in the documentary film, {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riding_Giants"}}{\fldrslt 
\i \cf3 Riding Giants}}.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton#cite_note-giants-4"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs22 \cf3 [4]}} The technique would later be modified to use {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_water_craft"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 personal water craft}} and become a popular innovation. {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tow-in_surfing"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Tow-in surfing}}, as it became known, pushed the confinements and possibilities of big wave surfing to a new level. Although met with mixed reactions from the surfing community, some of whom felt that it was cheating and polluting, Hamilton explained that tow-in surfing was the only way to catch the monstrous sized waves. Using tow-in surfing methods, Hamilton learned how to survive 70-foot (21\'a0m) waves and carving arcs across walls of water.

They later married on November 30, 1997. In 1996, People magazine named Hamilton one of the 50 Most Beautiful People in the World, and in the same year Hamilton pushed for and took from his future wife the correspondent position for the syndicated cable series 'The Extremists'.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton#cite_note-mahalo.com-5"}}{\fldrslt

In 1996 Hamilton and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_Bertin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Manu Bertin}} were instrumental in demonstrating and popularizing kitesurfing off the Hawaiian coast of Maui. In 1999 Hamilton sailed his windsurfer between the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kauai"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kaua\uc0\u699 i}}, some fifty miles away, in just under six hours..

Hamilton has also experimented with the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foilboard"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 foilboard}}, an innovative {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfboard"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 surfboard}} which incorporates {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofoil"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 hydrofoil}} technology allowing a higher degree of precision and effectiveness of aerial techniques within the water.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton#cite_note-9"}}{\fldrslt

Purist surfers have blasted him for this, but Hamilton calls it a return to the traditional Hawaiian way of surfing, as practiced by King {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamehameha_I"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Kamehameha I}} and his queen {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaahumanu"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 Ka\uc0\u699 ahumanu}} almost three hundred years ago.\

On that day, with a larger than normal ocean swell, Darrick Doerner piloted the watercraft, towing Hamilton. Pulling in and releasing the tow rope, Hamilton drove down into the well of the wave's enormous tunnel vortex, in full view of boat-based photographers' and videographers' cameras. With his signature artistic flair, Hamilton continued deeply carving water, emerging back over the wave's shoulder.

\b0\fs26 \cf0 In 2007, when Brett Lickle was towing Hamilton into a wave on the Maui north shore, a wave knocked Lickle from the watercraft. The fin on a surfboard sliced Lickle, causing him to bleed into the sea, which he feared would attract sharks. Hamilton swam to recover the watercraft, found Lickle in the surf, fashioned his swimsuit into a cloth tourniquet, and applied it to Lickle to save his life. Hamilton then piloted the watercraft back to a landing, where Lickle was immediately taken to a hospital for treatment.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laird_Hamilton#cite_note-13"}}{\fldrslt
