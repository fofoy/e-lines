His love for the mountains stemmed from early childhood. Bernd grew up in the middle of the mountains spending summers on his grandfather’s farm and hiking for hours with his father. In 1994, the "natural born freeclimber" started climbing. Initially it was more alpine climbing with a Peter Grisseman, a mountainguide from the local village. The "big walls" in the alps was their goal. When he was 16, Bernd climbed the "Grand Capucin" (Mt. Blanc, France), and was probably the youngest person to reach the top of this mountain at that time. Later on, the Team did some classic routes in the "Wilder Kaiser" and the Dolomites.'},
