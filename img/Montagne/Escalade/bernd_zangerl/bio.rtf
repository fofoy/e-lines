\f0\fs22 \cf0 \cb2 Bouldering is much more to me than just crimping on small holds. It's being outside in nature and enjoying a beautiful piece of landscape. I'm always looking for new boulder areas, the perfect boulder, the most aesthetical line. Bouldering just simply is fun. Best thing is you try it out yourself!!"\
